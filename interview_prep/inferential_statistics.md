# Inferential Statistics1. **What descriptive measures in statistics do you know?**    - **measures of central tendency**        - mean        - median        - mode    - **measures of spread**        - variance        - standard deviation        - range        - interquartile range    - **frequency distribution**    - **skewness**    - **measures of multivariate dependence**        - covariance        - Pearson's r        - Spearman's rho    - **goodness of fit**        - Pearson's chi-squared1. **Whatâ€™s the difference between the mean, the median and the mode?**    - the mean is the average of all numbers in a set (the sum of all numbers divided by the length of the set)    - the median is the number in the middle of a set of numbers    - the mode is the number that appears the most frequently in a set1. **What is the difference between Type I and Type II error?**    - Type I errors are rejecting the null hypothesis even though it is true (False Positive)    - Type II errors are failing to reject the null hypothesis even though it is false (False Negative)1. **What is a p-value, and what is it used for?**    - p-value (or probability value) is the probability of seeing a statistic at least as extreme as was calculated assuming the null hypothesis to be true    - using the predetermined significance level, the p-value is used to determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis1. **What are the null and alternative hypothesis in a statistical test?**    - the null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no statistically significant difference between two samples or populations; the null hypothesis is assumed to be true until summarily rejected    - the alternative hypothesis is the counter to the null hypothesis and states that there is significant difference between the groups1. **What is a t-test? Do you know what is its relationship to the z-test?**    - Student's t-test is used to determine if two samples are significantly different from one another when the population's true standard deviation are not known. To use a t-test, it is assumed that the distribution is normal in order to estimate the standard deviation.    - The t-test is similar to the z-test in that it is estimating the area of a normal distribution in order to determine the difference between two sets of data. The z-test, however, is used when the population's standard deviation is known or the sample size is considered to be large enough.1. **What is the power of a statistical test?**    - the power of a statistical test is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is false1. **What is the standard deviation?**    - the standard deviation is a measure of the variability or spread in a set of data points1. **What is a confidence interval, and what is it used for?**    - a confidence interval is a range of values that, with the stated level of confidence, is believe to contain the true value of the measured statistic; for example, if measuring a population mean, a 95% confidence interval is a range of values within which it is believe that the true population will be contained 95% of the time1. **What is bootstrapping/resampling used for?**    - bootstrapping is used to generate statistics from a sample based on resampling with replacement. It allows for hypothesis testing with better defined estimated statistics by generating larger sample sizes.1. **Do you know the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics?**    - frequentist statistics use statistics measured and estimated from samples and populations to make inferences    - Bayesian statistics uses known covariant statistics and prior probabilities to make inferences on unknown data/statistics1. **What are outliers? How can you check for them?**    - outliers are data points that lie outside the "normal" range of values (usually 1.5x above or below the interquartile range (IQR)    - you can check for outliers by visualizing your data with scatterplot, boxplots, etc. or you can calculate outlier using the IQR1. **What is a correlation coefficient? What range of values can it take?**    - a correlation coefficient is used to describe the relationship between two values    - the values range from -1.0 (completely negatively correlated) to +1.0 (completely positively correlated)1. ***What is the Central Limit Theorem?***    - The Central Limit Theorem states that when the number of samples of any distribution with a well-defined mean and variance approaches infintity, the distribution will approximate a normal distribution that is spread around one central value1. **What is the normal distribution? How can you test if data is normally distributed?**    - a normal distribution is an approximately symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution that describes the probability distribution of a particular data set or population   - one can test if data is normally distributed by visualizing the data graphically, using hypothesis testing, or calculating a goodness-of-fit statistics such as Pearson's chi-squared1. **Can you explain the major types of plots - histogram, bar chart, box plot, and scatter plot?**    - histograms are used to show frequency distributions for continuous variables    - bar charts are used for frequency distributions of discrete or categorical variable    - box plots are used to show the spread of data including the quartiles, median, and outliers    - scatter plots are used to show the relationship between two variables1. **What is a correlation matrix?**    - a correlation matrix is a table that provides the correlation coefficients between multiple variables
