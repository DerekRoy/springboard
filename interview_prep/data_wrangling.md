# Practice Interview Questions: Data Wrangling## Pandas**What data structures does pandas introduce which arenâ€™t native to Python?**> 1. **Series**: a one-dimensional array that can contain any datatype.    > The basic method to create a Series is:>    >           `s = pd.Series(data, index=index)`>    > `data` in this case may refer to many different things such as a Python dictionary, an ndarray, or a scalar value.>    > `index` is a list of axis labels> 1. **DataFrames**: a two-dimensional array with columns of potentially different data types (although data types must be consistent within a column)    > The basic method to create a DataFrame is:>    >        `df = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index, columns=columns)`>    > `data` may refer to many different things such as: a dictionary of 1D ndarrays, lists, dicts, or Series; 2-D numpy.ndarray; Structured or record ndarray;  Series; another DataFrame>    > `index` is a list of row labels>    > `columns` is a list of column labels> For more info: [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html)**How can you deal with missing values?**> 1. Keep them in place if they do not interfere with data processing.> 1. Drop rows or columns with any or all missing values:>        `df.dropna(axis='index'/'columns', how='any'/'all')`> 1. Fill in the missing values using one of the following methods:>    `df.fillna()`>    * Can fill missing values using a scalar, dict, Series, or DataFrame (`value=`)    * Or fill missing values using backfill (`method=bfill`) or forwardfill (`method=ffill`) method            * `df.bfill()` is a synonym for `df.fillna(method='bfill')`        * `df.ffill()` is a synonym for `df.fillna(method='ffill')`>    `df.interpolate()`>    *  interpolate missing values using different methods such as linear, time,  nearest, zero, quadratic, polynomial, etc.**What is the difference between the .loc and the .iloc indexers?***  `.loc` uses index labels, whereas `.iloc` uses integer positions * `.loc` will raise a `KeyError` when items are not found, whereas `.iloc` will raise an `IndexError` if the indexer is out-of-bounds (except during slicing, where indexers are allowed to be out-of-bounds)**What file formats for storing data do you know?*** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)* TXT (Plain Text)* RTF (Rich Text Format)* XLS, XLSX (Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet)* DOCX (Microsoft Word Document)* BIN (binary)* HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5)* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)* HDFS (Hadoop Filesystem)* XML (Extensible Markup Language)* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)* PDF (Portable Document Format)* SHP (ShapeFile)* SAS (Statistical Analysis Software)* SAV (SPSS file format)* DTA (STATA file format)* ROOT (Data Analysis Framework from CERN)* Audio File Formats (MP3, WAV, etc) * Image File Formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc)* Video File Formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, etc)* Archive File Formats (ZIP, TAR, RAR, 7zip, etc)**What is the standard way of marking missing values in pandas?****Video: What features of pandas do you like particularly? Any that you dislike?****What kind of indexes exist in pandas DataFrames?**## SQL**What are aggregations in SQL?****Can you explain the different types of SQL JOINs?****Give an example of some aggregation functions in SQL.****Can you explain the difference between the WHERE and HAVING filters?**
