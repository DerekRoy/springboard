But, is this value statistically correct? In this exercise, we will examine [a dataset from the Journal of Statistics Education](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/jse_data_archive.htm) to estimate the true normal human body temperature.## Describing the Data<table style="width:100%">  <tr>    <th  class="verticalSplit" style="border-bottom:1px solid gray">Total Population</th>    <th  class="verticalSplit" style="border-bottom:1px solid gray">Female Population</th>     <th  class="verticalSplit" style="border-bottom:1px solid gray">Male Population</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <td  class="verticalSplit">Sample Mean: 98.25<sup>o</sup></td>    <td  class="verticalSplit">Sample Mean: 98.39<sup>o</sup></td>     <td  class="verticalSplit">Sample Mean: 98.10<sup>o</sup></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td  class="verticalSplit">Sample Standard Deviation: 0.73</td>    <td  class="verticalSplit">Sample Standard Deviation: 0.74</td>     <td  class="verticalSplit">Sample Standard Deviation: 0.69</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td  class="verticalSplit" style="border-bottom:1px solid gray">Population Count: 130</td>    <td  class="verticalSplit" style="border-bottom:1px solid gray">Population Count: 65</td>     <td  class="verticalSplit" style="border-bottom:1px solid gray">Population Count: 65</td>  </tr></table>Although none of the sample means are equal to assumed mean of 98.6<sup>o</sup>, the assumed mean is within one standard deviation for each population. To further examine the true population mean, we will first need to make sure that our sample abides by certain assumptions:1. it is a random sampling    * it is assumed that this was a random sampling and not taken from a subgroup that would alter the outcome of analysis1. each observation is independent    * we can assume this based on the fact that the sample is much less than 10% of the total population1. the sample distribution is approximately normal    * let's look at this one graphically and then quantitatively### Is the sample data normally distributed?![sample vs normal distribution](img/sample_v_normal.png)
