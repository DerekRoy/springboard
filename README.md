# Springboard Data Science Bootcamp
This repository houses the projects completed during my time in (Springboard's Data Science Career Track Bootcamp)[https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track]. Below is a list of projects with descriptions and links.

## Capstone 1: [Predicting the Neighborhood-level Prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease](predicting_chronic_disease)
This project entails gathering data from the CDC and U.S. Census Bureau API and using nearly 400 features on 28,000 census tracts from the 500 largest cities in the United States to predict the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The ability to predict neighborhood-level prevalence may help to reduce the personal and economic costs of CKD through targeted public health campaigns.

**Key Skills**

* Data wrangling and cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization (including data maps)

**Data Sources**

* [500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health (Centers for Disease Control)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/500-cities-local-data-for-better-health-b32fd)
* [American Community Survey 5-year Data API (U.S. Census Bureau)](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html)

### [Analyzing Human Body Temperature](EDA_human_temperature)
This mini-project focused on using statistical analysis to determine if 98.6<sup>o</sup>F is actually the average human body temperature.

**Key Skills**

* bootstrap / frequentists statistical analysis
* hypothesis testing with one-sample inference
* pandas | seaborn | matplotlib

### [Quandl Financial Data API](API)
Pull financial data from the Quandl API in order to calculate descriptive statistics.

**Key Skills**

* descriptive statistics

### [SQL Mini-Project](sql_mini_project.sql)
This project entailed writing a SQL query script to pull data from a fictional facilities dataframe

**Key Skills**
* SQL / MySQL queries

### [Wrangling World Bank Data with JSON](data_wrangling_json)
Pull data from a JSON file into Python to generate descriptive statistics.

**Key Skills**
* reading JSON files directly into pandas
* descriptive statistics
* data visualization with pandas
